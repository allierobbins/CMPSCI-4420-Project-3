This is the README file for Allie Robbins' Digital Image Assignment 3

All files were written in C++ on Visual Studio 2017, referencing OpenCV 3.4.1.

List of Files included in program:
  - program1
  - program2
  - program3
  - program4
  - program5
  - program6
  - makefile
  - README

To execute the program:
    Run command "make" to build/compile the programs.
    Run command "./programName imageName" to run a program after it is built.

      For program6, if the ROI is given from the command line:
        ./program6 imageName -f pointX pointY width height

    PLEASE NOTE: these programs compile slowly, they may take a little time


To clean the object files:
    Run command "make clean".

Purpose of program:
    The purpose of this program is perform image enhancements in Spatial Domain.

Outline of Assignment 2 by program:
  - PROGRAM 1: Write a program that will show the pixel value at a mouse click.

  - PROGRAM 2: Use the mean value to threshold the image such that all the
      pixels below the mean value are changed to black and all the other pixels
      are changed to white.

  - PROGRAM 3: Write a program to perform histogram equalization on a specified
      image.

  - PROGRAM 4: Write a program to perform histogram matching of a given image
      to another image, or a specified histogram.

  - PROGRAM 5: Write a function to specify a region of interest (ROI) in an image.
      Run the histogram equalization function on this ROI and put it back into
      the original image.

  - PROGRAM 6: Subtract an image from its histogram equalized image and display
      the result.
